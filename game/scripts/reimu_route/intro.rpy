    petra "... I think I'll try talking to Reimu." 

    # nina Happy 
    nina "That's great! You'd be doing her and the rest of us a favor too. She could use the company and social interaction as well after all."

    nina "And besides, you two seem to have gotten along well enough when you first met, right?" 

    petra "(Well, I wouldn't describe being terrified of her at first as getting along, but after I realized that she doesn't mean harm... I guess it wasn't that scary anymore.)" 
    petra "... I guess so."
    petra "(She might understand my experience a bit better too since she's not here as a researcher either…)"

    nina "Then I guess that settles it! If you run into any more issues, just let us know. We're always here to help." 

    # peter Smug
    peter "Even though I'm so busy… I guess I can find some time to babysit you. As your senpai, I have some obligations after all."

    # petra Annoyed 
    petra "(Haa! There he goes again with the senpai thing.)"

    # petra Deadpan Stare
    petra "(Nina said that he's usually joking, but is his sense of humor really this broken? Should we be worried?)"

    # petra Angry (substitute for Determined look)
    petra "(Well regardless, for now I should just focus on the task at hand.)"

    # petra Default
    petra "(Speaking of which...)" 

    # petra Soft Sad Smile 
    petra "(... I hope Reimu and I can get along.)"
