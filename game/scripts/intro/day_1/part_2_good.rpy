    petra "Hmm...making friends?"
    petra "(Is it just me or does that sound kinda strange... making friends? As a task??)"

    nina "Hehe, maybe it's better to not think of it as a ‘task,' per se, but it's still crucial to the program. I'll elaborate."
    nina "As you know, humans are social beings and communities mean a lot to them. Even if you're not interested in being a part of any community, knowing how to navigate through one is a very useful skill." 
    nina "And the first step for being in any community, is to understand the people in the community and to know how to express yourself to the people in the community." 
    nina "And one of the most basic forms of knowing people and expressing yourself is through making friends!" 
    petra "Oh I see..." 
    petra "(Hmm I guess it does make sense when I think of it like that.)"
    nina "And you don't have to go up to absolute strangers on the streets or anything like that."
    nina "You can just try talking to the other patients or researchers here."
    petra "What about you? I talk to you." 

    show nina laugh
    nina "Awww… You're adorable, Honey~" 

    show nina happy
    nina "But unfortunately I don't count cause we're already good friends."
    nina "Besides, I can't have you cling to me forever."
    nina "I'm sure you'll find someone you'd like to be friends with." 
    nina "And don't worry, I'll help you along the way." 
    petra "Okay... I'll, um, I'll think about it."
