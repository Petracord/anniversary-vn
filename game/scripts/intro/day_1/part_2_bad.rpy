    petra "(Wha- huh?? That's a task!?)"
    petra "W-Wait! What do you mean by ''make friends?''"

    nina "Well as you know, humans are social beings and communities mean a lot to them. Even if you're not interested in being a part of any community, knowing how to navigate through one is a very useful skill." 
    nina "And the first step for being in any community, is to understand the people in the community and to know how to express yourself to the people in the community." 
    nina "And one of the most basic forms of knowing people and expressing yourself is through making friends!"

    petra "Oh I see..." 
    petra "(I guess it's kinda strange but it does make sense when I think of it like that. I shouldn't keep being so quick to react like that…)"

    show petra annoyed
    petra "(But why are they saying that as if that's something to be learned? I thought making friends just happened… Like naturally? What's the deal with making it a task…)"
    petra "(I've never had any prior experience, so would I even be ready? How does one even go about actively trying to make friends?)"

    nina "Yep, what's more is that you don't have to go up to absolute strangers on the streets or anything like that."
    nina "You can just try talking to the other patients or researchers here."
    petra "What about you? I talk to you." 

    show nina laugh
    nina "Awww… You're adorable, Honey~" 

    show nina happy
    nina "But unfortunately I don't count cause we're already good friends."
    nina "Besides, I can't have you cling to me forever."
    nina "I'm sure you'll find someone you'd like to be friends with." 
    nina "And don't worry, I'll help you along the way." 

    show petra anxious
    petra "(All of this sounds reasonable, but...)"
    petra "(Is this really what the next step should be?)"
    petra "(Actually... shouldn't I get a say in what the next stage of the program is...?)"

    show nina worried
    nina "Petra? You look worried. Is something bothering you?" 

    show petra shocked
    petra "Huh? W-Worried?" 

    show petra anxious
    petra "Well... Umm, I–" 
    petra "Uhh I-I was... thinking..."
    petra "(What am I doing? What am I saying??)" 
    petra "T-This is kinda... I mean-"
    petra "(Why can't I say anything...)"
    nina "Petra, it's okay."
    petra "Huh?"

    nina "Is it about the new task? Would you like more time to think about it?" 

    show petra default
    petra "... y-yeah!"

    show nina happy
    nina "I see, that's totally understandable and fine! Take all the time you need Honey."
    nina "And if you have any questions or worries, just let me know."
