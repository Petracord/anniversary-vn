    petra "(It's in the garden? Huh, is it something big?)"
    petra "(A tree?!)"
    petra "(Why does it looks best at night…?)"
    petra "(A Christmas tree that lights up! That's something… they celebrate, right? Is it around that time of year?)"
    petra "(No, no! That's an absurd gift regardless.)"
    petra "(Hmm, I am curious but…)"
    petra "...alright, I'll go at night"
