    petra "(Like, what is this even a celebration of? 'Congrats, you've made it a whole month without any complications! What a good girl you've been!' What kind of celebration is that?)" 


    show petra shocked

    petra "(I've survived in Antarctica all these years on my own! I'm more than capable of adapting to new environments!)" 

    show petra angry
    petra "W-Well, thank you for the present but- I don't need it!" 
    petra "I... I don't need to be celebrated either… N-Not for just surviving a month here!" 
    petra "I know this is a rehab center and I'm only still adjusting to human society and all, but…"
    petra "But I don't need to be coddled!!"
