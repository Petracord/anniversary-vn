    nina "Honey, I don't know what you're talking about, but God Perceives All is their best song yet." 
    peter "Mother, I love you, but I ought to disagree." 
    peter "Clearly, Cope in the Dark is superior in every way."  

    # Pe Deadpan
    petra "(... I can't believe this.)"
    petra "(I knew Peter had weird food takes, but weird music takes too? How can someone be so wrong?)"

    # Pe Default

    nina "Okay, okay, Cope in the Dark is good… It's a fun party song." 
    nina "But have you heard the lyrics for God Perceives All? It's so well-crafted, it's full of subtext and wordplay." 
    nina "And you can feel the passion in the vocals!" 
    petra "(Mhm, exactly! Nina gets it, even though I'm still learning about human culture, even I can feel how special this song is.)"
    peter "Eh, it's mid." 

    # Nina Serious
    # Nina gasp sfx (if we can manage it!) 
    nina "You-! Young man, you take that back right now." 

    peter "It's mid." 

    # Nina gasp sfx 
    nina "That's it." 
    nina "You’re disowned." 

    # Ptr Worried
    peter "Fweh?! Wait, what? Disowned??" 
    peter "Wait, you can't disown me for this!" 

    # Ni Smug 
    nina "Of course I can. I just did." 
    nina "And besides, you were adopted to begin with." 

    # Ptr Terrified
    peter "MOM????" 

    # Ni Excited 
    nina "I'm sorry to suddenly say this Petra, but you don't have a brother anymore." 

    # Blocking: Petra sprite rises to normal height
    # Blocking: Flip Pe sprite toward Ni or Ptr when she speaks to or is spoken to by one of them
    # Pe Deadpan Stare 
    petra "... but he was never my brother to begin with."

    # Pe Annoyed
    petra "(We aren't related just because we're Frost Penguins...)"

    nina "Now that's my daughter, you catch on so fast, Honey!" 
    peter "Wait a second, you're moving on too fast!! At least hear me out!" 

    # Pe Default
    # Ni Smug 
    nina "Hmm? Did someone say anything? I couldn’t hear anything since I'm busy talking to my one and only Penguin baby." 
    nina "Petra, did you say anything?"  

    # Pe Soft Sad Smile)
    petra "Heh… Nothing." 

    # Ptr Sad 
    peter "Oh, come on, not you too..." 
    peter "Alright, fine! God Perceives All is a good song." 
    nina "Hmm… Not exactly what I was looking for… Try again." 
    peter "''It's alright to have different opinions but be polite.''" 

    # Ni Excited 
    nina "There you go! It wasn't that hard now, was it?" 

    # Ptr Angry 
    peter "Very." 

    petra "Heh…"
    petra "(Geez, so dramatic…)" 
    petra "(Somehow... seeing them be so silly is kinda relaxing...)"

    # Ptr Smug
    peter "Well, someone's awfully emotive today."
    peter "Did they finally teach you how to smile?"

    # Pe Shocked
    petra "...?!!" 
    petra "(W-What? Where did that come from all of a sudden?!)"

    # Pe Deadpan Stare
    petra "(Was it something I said...? No, I don't think so...)"

    # Pe Annoyed
    petra "(Does he not have anything better to do than trying to tease me?)"

    # Pe Angry
    petra "Teach me how to smile?! What do you mean!?" 
    peter "Oh you know, cause you barely ever smile, I figured they got worried and gave you supplementary classes."
    petra "Thanks for your concern, but I don't need supplementary classes!"
    petra "Though I can't say the same about you; maybe you should rejoin as a rescue again to learn some manners!"

    # Ptr Angry 
    peter "Well I–"
    # Nina Serious 
    nina "Alright, that's enough you two, knock it off." 
    nina "No one is getting any supplementary classes."

    # Ptr Sad 
    peter "... fine." 

    # Pe Annoyed 
    petra "(He started it.)"  

    # Pe Deadpan Stare
    petra "(Oh well, whatever. I guess I'll let him off for today.)" 

    # Ni Happy 
    nina "By the way, Petra, I've been meaning to ask. How's your recent task for the Socialization Program going?" 

    petra "... ..." 

    # Pe Anxious/Sad 
    petra "(Oh no... I was hoping she wouldn't ask about that...)"

    # Ptr Default 
    nina "Petra?" 

    # Pe Default (Shy)
    petra "Still in the planning stage...?"
    # Ni Worried 
    nina "You're having trouble, aren't you? It's okay Petra, you can tell us, we're here to help." 

    # Pe Default
    petra "...we?" 

    # Ptr Angry 
    peter "Well, you are annoying, but that doesn't mean I won't help."

    # Ptr Happy
    peter "Besides, is it too far-fetched to think that I might decide to help you out here and there?" 

    # Pe Annoyed 
    petra "(That's... surprisingly nice of him.)" 
    petra "... I guess not." 

    # Ni Happy 
    nina "See Petra, you're not alone. We're here with you." 

    # Pe Shocked 
    petra "(Nina...)" 

    # Pe Soft Sad Smile 
    petra "..." 
    petra "Yeah… Yeah, I guess I could use some help." 

    # Ni Excited
    nina "That settles it then! Let's get started."

    # Ptr Worried
    peter "You know, you still haven't told me what her new task exactly is." 

    # Ni Happy 
    nina "Oh right, let me explain." 

    # Pe Default 
    petra "(Yeah, I think I'll leave the explaining to Nina.)" 

    # Pe Deadpan Stare
    petra "(Sometimes… She can be so cheesy, no wonder Peter turned out so dramatic.)" 

    # Pe Soft Sad Smile 
    petra "(Maybe it's not that bad after all.)"

    petra "So that leaves..." 

    nina "Selen, Rosemi, and Reimu." 

    peter "Yep, it should be fairly easy to approach any of them for a simple talk." 

    # Pe Thinking Hard 
    petra "(Selen seems very friendly and they both said she's a great conversationalist, so I could really learn a thing or two from talking to her.)"
    petra "(Then there's also Rosemi… She's very friendly too, and Nina said Rosemi had the same issues as me… I really want to know how she became more outgoing.)" 

    # Pe Anxious/Sad 
    petra "(But they're also so busy most of the time... I don't want to bother them...)" 

    # Pe Thinking Hard 
    petra "(And at last, Reimu… She spends a lot of time in her room, so I haven't seen her much… But Nina said that if I go talk to her, she won't turn me away.)" 

    # Pe Anxious/Sad expression 
    petra "(I'm curious about her... She seems mysterious, and maybe... she's kinda like me...)" 

    # Ni Worried 
    nina "Petra?" 

    petra "(Hmm… Or not? Am I thinking too much about this?)" 

    # Ptr Angry
    petra "Hey! Earth to Petra! Are you still here?" 

    # Pe Shocked
    petra "Fweh-?" 

    # Pe Default 
    petra "Oh sorry, I wasn't listening." 

    # Ni Happy 
    nina "It's fine, I was just asking if there was anyone you wanted to talk to." 

    # Pe Default
    petra "(Right... I have to make a decision...)"
