    nina "Okay, okay, Cope in the Dark is good… It's a fun party song." 
    nina "But have you heard the lyrics for God Perceives All? It's so well-crafted, it's full of subtext and wordplay." 
    nina "And you can feel the passion in the vocals!" 
    petra "(Mhm, exactly! Nina gets it, even though I'm still learning about human culture, even I can feel how special this song is.)"

    petra "Teach me how to smile?! What do you mean!?" 
    peter "Oh you know, cause you barely ever smile, I figured they got worried and gave you supplementary classes."
    petra "Thanks for your concern, but I don't need supplementary classes!"
    petra "Though I can't say the same about you; maybe you should rejoin as a rescue again to learn some manners!"
